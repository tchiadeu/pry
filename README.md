# Setup Pry

A quick setup to customize the prompt using pry & rails.  
After installation, the prompt will match the current directory name or the rails app name (with an hint for the current env).  
Examples :  
> running `pry` inside **_~/code/current_project_** : `[1] current_project(main) >`  
> running `rails console` inside **_~/code/current_project_** : `[1] current_project(dev) >`

> [!NOTE]
> For production env, the environment name appear in red ðŸŸ¥ (the red configured in your terminal)
